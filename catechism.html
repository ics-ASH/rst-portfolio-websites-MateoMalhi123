        <h2>Catechism</h2>
        <p>Viewing a career as a computer engineer, I see my role as contributing to the common good by using technology to improve people's lives. The vocation of humanity is to reflect the image of God and strive towards becoming more like His Son. In my work, I aim to fulfill this by developing new software and systems that make things easier and more efficient for everyone. This way, I'm living out my calling to help others and make a positive difference in society. This guiding principle shapes my goals and priorities, both at work and in my personal life.<p>
